This is a mini project which demonstrates use of automated caption generation for social media posts using OpenAI API.


OpenAI enables developers to integrate powerful natural language processing capabilities. In our project, we have used the OpenAI API integrated with Javascript. For this, we took reference from the OpenAI official documentation on available models, parameters, and usage guidelines.  OpenAI primarily provided API access, allowing developers to interact with their powerful language models by making HTTP requests to designated endpoints. Users could integrate OpenAI's capabilities into their applications by crafting requests using programming languages like JavaScript.
Steps for OpenAI API integration :
i.	Sign up for OpenAI API: First, you need to sign up for the OpenAI API and get your API key.
ii.	Install required packages:
 Install axios:
Axios is a popular HTTP client for making API requests in JavaScript. It is used  to communicate with the OpenAI API. Install Axios by running ‘npm install axios’.
Install openai:
Users can interact with the API through HTTP request with official Node.js library ‘openai’. It can be installed with the command ‘npm install openai’.
iii.	Set Up Node.js Backend:
•	Initialize a new Node.js project using the command ‘npm init’.
•	Install necessary dependencies using npm. Here we use axios HTTP client library to make requests to the OpenAI API.
•	Set up a server using Express.js.
iv.	Integrate OpenAI API with Node.js Backend:
•	Use your API key to authenticate requests to the OpenAI API. You'll need to include your API key in the request headers. Refer OpenAI documentation for more information.
•	Write the necessary logic to interact with the OpenAI API endpoints, such as creating a function to send requests for text generation.
v.	Set Up React.js Frontend:
•	Initialize a new React.js app using the command ‘npx create-react-app’.
•	Install necessary dependencies using npm. You may need additional libraries depending on your project’s frontend requirements.
vi.	Implement Text Generation in React.js:
•	Create a form or input field where users can input text.
•	Handle user input and send it to your Node.js backend.
•	Display the generated text returned from the OpenAI API on the frontend
